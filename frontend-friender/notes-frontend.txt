BIG BUG!!

1. After we made our frontend (app with state and funcs, routes, navbar, profile edit form), we tried to run only the frontend on our server and got 30+ error messages. Most were about some kind of webpack 5 > polyfill error. We also got an error that the axios module couldn't be resolved. 

2. We noticed that even though we hadn't installed axios on the frontend but we were still able to make the axios post request to AWS upload a pic file.

3. So then we decided to install axios. All other webpack errors were still there. 

4. We noticed most of them referenced an issue with "crypto" and other "aws-" affiliated issues. We searched our frontend files for these and saw all of them were in our package-log.json. We figured since we weren't explicitly using the "aws-sdk/client-s3" package, we uninstalled it. 

5. After this, when we ran our frontend server it couldn't build our app at all!

6. We deleted our package-lock.json and package.json to try to install everything from scratch, not thinking about how with create-react-app that it does a lot of config for us under the hood. We only had dependencies with absolutely nothing else :(

7. Lidan fixed this by:
    -deleted the package.json and package-lock.json
    -copied both files from the frontend jobly solution
    -then she ran 'npm install web-vitals --save-dev' (without the quotes)
